  <h1> Roles in Key Club</h1>

  <h2> President</h2>
  <p> The club president is responsible for setting and monitoring the goals of the club, running club meetings, appointing committee chairs and delegating tasks as necessary, recruiting, training and retaining members and maintaining regular communication with the lieutenant governor of his or her division.
</p>


    <h2> Vice President</h2>
    <p> The role of the club vice president can be summarized in one word: service. The vice president serves the president, other club officers, committees and the general membership. He or she is also expected to learn the duties of the president in order to fill in or take over as necessary.
  </p>

    <h2> Secretary</h2>
    <p> While a club secretary’s duties may be tailored to fit his/her specific Key Club, general responsibilities can be found across the entire NJ District. The club secretary is the go-to person for records and reports and should understand how Key Club functions at the club level.

  </p>

    <h2> Treasurer</h2>
    <p> The club treasurer controls the club’s money, both its collection and disbursement. He or she collects member dues, prepares and monitors the budget and maintains accurate financial records.


  </p>

    <h2> Editor</h2>
    <p> The club editor is responsible for keeping the membership informed about important activities, opportunities and deadlines at the club, district and international level. The “bulletin” may be a printed piece or electronic update.
  </p>

    <h2> Webmaster</h2>
    <p> The club webmaster is reponsible for updating the club website with the latest events, contact information, pictures, and more! The person in this position is also responsible for assisting the club's members and executives with any technology issues or concerns.

  </p>
  <h2> General Member</h2>
    <p> Without general members, Key Club would not be what it is today! These individuals are the driving force behind the organization's service activities and strength in general.
